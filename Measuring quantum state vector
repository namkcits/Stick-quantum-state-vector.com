# This code demonstrates measuring a quantum statevector
from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector

# Create the statevector to be measured
state = Statevector([0.70710678-0.70710678j, 0.0+0.0j], dims=(2,))

# Measure the statevector
result = state.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(result)  # Returns either 0 or 1 with probabilities |0.5-0.5j|^2 and 0, respectively
